# Omakub

! This is a FORK of the original [Basecamp's Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/). This fork is intended to be a personal version of the original Omakub, with some personal preferences and configurations.

Turn a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
